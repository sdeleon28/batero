"""Recording: the game's own frames, the sound card's output and an optional camera (the
iPhone), each to its own file, and editions rendered from those raws.

    V in the game starts and stops a take. Every take is its own folder in ~/Movies/drumhero/:

        <stamp> <name>/
            take.json                 when, how long, what was played, where everything is
            raw/screen.mp4            the game exactly as it was on screen (the window's size)
            raw/camera.mp4            the iPhone, 1920x1080
            raw/audio.wav             the interface's mix
            computer.mp4              edition: the screen, 16:9, the camera picture-in-picture
            social.mp4                edition: 1080x1920 for Reels / TikTok / Shorts: the screen as a
                                      thumbnail across the top, the camera under it (capture_split
                                      of the height, cropped to fill), the pair centred vertically
            edits/<edition>-<style>/  what Claude cut from an edition (edit.py)

    Both editions are rendered when the take stops (the user manages the disk). They can be
    rendered again from the raws at any time: the Edit screen, or
    `python -m drumhero.capture --render "<take folder>" social`.

How it works, and why not a screen recorder:
- Video: the game hands a copy of its surface to a writer thread 30 times a second; the
  thread converts it and pipes raw frames into ffmpeg (h264 by VideoToolbox). No screen
  recording permission, no display to pick, and the main loop only pays for one blit.
- Audio: a sounddevice input stream on the interface (default "X18/XR18"), two of its
  input channels (default 17-18: set the XR18's USB sends 17/18 to Main L/R in X-AIR
  Edit and they carry exactly the mix you hear, the game and Bitwig included). Written
  to a WAV by a thread. `python -m drumhero.capture --check` shows which channels have
  signal.
- Camera (optional): ffmpeg's avfoundation records the first video device whose name
  matches the camera setting ("iPhone" by default, so Continuity Camera or Camo) to its
  own file, on the same clock as the game's frames.
- Sync: the picture is sampled by wall clock (frame n = n / FPS s after the start, missed
  slots repeat the previous frame); the wav is rewritten onto the take's clock from the
  arrival time of every audio block (the interface's sample clock is not ours); then
  measure_sync tracks the drum's onsets against the MIDI strokes over the take (re-timing
  the wav if the offset moves) and measures the camera delay from the camera's view of the
  monitor, all into take.json.
- Editions: ffmpeg overlays the camera on the game raw and muxes the audio with those
  corrections (render_edition). The raws stay, so both editions can be made from one take.
