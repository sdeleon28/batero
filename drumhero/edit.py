"""Edit a take with Claude Code: pick a style, no typing, and Claude cuts the video.

The game writes a job folder inside the take's folder (<take>/edits/<edition>-<style>/; for the
flat takes recorded before the folders existed, ~/Movies/drumhero/edits/<take>/) with
job.json (the take, its sidecar with timing and the run logs of the levels played during
it, the chosen style and its brief) and starts `claude -p` there, allowed to use ffmpeg,
ffprobe and files only. Claude produces edit-<style>.mp4 in that folder and writes
claude.log. The game polls the thread and shows the state bottom right.

PROMPT = """You are editing a drum-practice video for the drummer who recorded it. Everything you need is in
job.json in the current directory. Work only in this directory. Use ffmpeg and ffprobe (both are
installed; the h264_videotoolbox encoder is available and fast) and write files here. Do not modify or
delete the inputs.

job.json fields:
- take: the recorded mp4 (the game's picture, the mix the drummer heard, and the camera, picture-in-picture
  or under the game in the 9:16 social edition). take_meta: its sidecar: t0 (epoch seconds of the first
  frame), duration, fps, size (of the computer raw; the mp4's own size may differ, check it with ffprobe).
- run_logs: JSON-lines files, one per level played during the take. Line 1 is a header (chart with every
  note: t in chart seconds, key, accent; stats with grade and stars; offset). The other lines are events
  with "wall" = epoch seconds: kind "hit" (judge PERFECT/GOOD/OK/STRAY, error_ms, velocity, dyn
  ACCENT/TAP/SOFT/LOUD, chart_t, combo), "miss", "ghost", "cc". Video time of an event = wall - t0.
  The chart's downbeats fall on chart_t multiples of 4 * 60 / bpm (bpm is in the header); a level's
  chart time 0 is at the wall time of its first hit minus that hit's chart_t.
- style, brief: what to make. Follow the brief.

Deliver exactly one file: {output}. Also write notes.md with the edit decisions (which moments and why)
in a few lines. Use drawtext for titles and captions (a system font like /System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.ttc
or Menlo); keep text inside the frame, readable, no more than two lines. Keep the output 1920x1080 or the
take's own size, 30 fps, h264_videotoolbox at 12M, AAC 192k, faststart. Check the result with ffprobe
(duration, streams) before finishing, and finish with one line: DONE <path> <duration seconds>."""
