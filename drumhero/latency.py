"""Offset fit: which latency offset would have scored a run best, and which one scores the
recent runs best together (asked for 2026-09-20: the user kept moving `offset_ms` between 20
and 85 without finding it, because one run's optimum is that run's own timing, not the chain).

Every stroke is re-judged against the chart at the run's offset plus a shift, with the game's
windows (PERFECT / GOOD / OK, nearest pending note within OK_MS), and the grade is the timing
grade (grade_for with no dynamics). `fit_game` gives the results box its line: this run's best
offset and what it would have gained, and the offset that maximises the mean grade over the
last RECENT runs of the profile (pooled), which is the number to set. Run logs carry the fit as
stats["offset_fit"]. `python -m drumhero.latency [--runs N] [--profile ID]` prints the sweep
over the recent logs.
