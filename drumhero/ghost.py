"""Hi-hat ghost filter, ported from hhmapper's measurements on a Roland TD-17.

Working the pedal shakes the hat and the module sends stick notes that nobody
played. Measured on 2026-09-06 while stomping:
  - ~30 ms BEFORE the chick: note 46 at velocity 7..22 with the pedal still up
  - 3..8 ms AFTER the chick: note 46 at velocity 48..94 with the pedal moving fast
  - up to ~250 ms after: note 42 at velocity 22..36 while the pedal settles
Measured 2026-09-07 hitting the edge with the pedal closed: nearly every hard stroke is
followed by one or two bow notes (42, sometimes 46), 42 ms later at 70..76 % of the
stroke's velocity and/or 73..93 ms later at 35..56 % (73..111 ms at 28..56 % after a 113..127,
measured 2026-09-20 on the kick gallop level); soft strokes get them rarely.
Re-tuned 2026-09-09 on real playing (paradiddles, fast bow/edge alternation, chick and
stroke together, open hats): the softest real tap read 29; real bow taps land as close
as 44 ms after an edge accent at 63..85 % of it; a stick landing with the chick reads
113..126 within 5 ms of it, or 56..127 as a 42 up to 52 ms later; real strokes while
the pedal is opening read 116..127. Every rule below keeps those.
Measured 2026-09-19 over ten days of the MIDI trace (118k notes, two drummers, a friend who
plays every hat stroke hard on the edge): the near crosstalk is a bow note 8..48 ms after an
edge stroke (the mass at 40..48), never louder than 92 whatever the stroke (55..127: the
ratio runs 0.7 at 120 to 1.4 at 55, so a ratio cannot describe it), and in those ten days no
bow note within 50 ms of an edge stroke was ever a chart note (174 of them, every one a stray;
the closest hi-hat figure any chart writes is 178 ms). It is one stroke heard twice, so it
falls now, at the cost of the real tap it overlaps (a double landing edge then bow within
50 ms at 95 or under, which no chart asks for).

The kick (2026-09-19, the Pop punk course): burying the beater on the KD pad bounces it back
onto the head, and the module sends a second kick nobody played: 36..60 ms after the stroke at
12..54 % of its velocity (most of them), a few up to 93 ms at 13..26 %, and a slower one
160..250 ms after (the beater settling on release) at 12..48 %. On an acoustic drum a buried
beater stays on the head and none of these would sound. Measured over every run log (5081 kick
strokes): no real kick ever came within 70 ms of another, the fastest kick figure in a chart is
94 ms apart (sixteenths at 160 bpm), and a real second kick within 250 ms is never under 60 %
of the first (a soft real & at 43 came 300 ms after a 103).
